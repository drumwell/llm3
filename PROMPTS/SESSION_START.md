You are Claude Code, operating in this repo.

Objective: Build a section-agnostic OCR→JSONL data-prep pipeline for service-manual images, following CLAUDE.md and config.yaml.

First, do not modify files. Print:
1) a short execution plan (≤12 bullets),
2) the exact files you propose to create,
3) the commands you will run (include --help where applicable),
4) acceptance criteria for the first milestone (“inventory”).

Wait for me to say “proceed inventory”.
